    <p class="irrelevant">I like to have fun with open ended projects like this.
      I hope the professor doesn't mind...</p>

    <p class="relevant">I was born in <strong>Princeton, New Jersey</strong>. I moved to
      <strong>Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania</strong>, at the age of five.</p>

    <p class="irrelevant">My favorite book is <em>The Name of the Wind</em>.
      Here is one of my favorite quotes from the book:</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2502879-the-name-of-the-wind">
      <p>“I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings.
        I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian
        and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University
        at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight
        that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to gods, loved women,
        and written songs that make the minstrels weep. You may have heard of me.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
